## Overview

Develop code that renders an elevator panel. Add JS code to make the 
elevator panel function according to the functional requirements below. 
You can control which way the elevator moves by selecting 
the floor buttons on the panel. As soon as a button is selected, the 
elevator will begin moving toward that floor.

red lights indicating whether the elevator is going up (green) or down 
(red). Floors are visible behind the elevator panel
